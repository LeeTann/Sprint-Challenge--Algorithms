#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) - Linear Time - it has one loop.


b) 0(n^2) - Quadratic Time - it's has a loop nested in a loop


c) 0(n) - Linear Time - it's a recursion that keeps calling itself and reducing each call by 1
